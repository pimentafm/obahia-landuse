  "modal_info_paraghaph01": "The landuse and land cover change classification of the Western Bahia region was done with the aid of cloud computing using the Python API on the Google Earth Engine platform and local processing using a set of programming languages and open source tools for geospatial analysis. More than 49,000 scenes were processed pixel by pixel and treated for atmospheric and relief correction, removal of pixels contaminated by clouds and cloud shadows and flaws at the edges. Physical variables such as mapping night lights, elevation data, pixel distance to rivers and major cities were added as bands to the data series.",
  "modal_info_paraghaph02": "From this data set, 31 annual mosaics were generated (from 1990 to 2020 - considering the best pixels observed in the time series) and from them several spectral indices were calculated. After dimension reduction analysis, 14 bands/indexes were defined as sufficient for the classification of landuse and land cover in the region, being: Night light (Night-time Light - NTL), Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), elevation, slope, azimuths, relief shadow, pixel distance for hydrography, Ratio (red/green), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), fractions of the Tasseled Cap transformation (brightness, greenness and wetness) and water mask.",
  "modal_info_paraghaph03": "The types of land use and occupation defined were forest formations, savanna formations, countryside formations, mosaic of agriculture or pasture, rainfed agriculture, irrigated agriculture, pasture, bodies of water and urban areas/rural buildings. The classification was made using the Random Forest classifier, trained with 28,500 random samples and processed with 500 decision trees for the cover and land use classes.",
  "modal_info_paraghaph04": "Interannual discontinuities were minimized using space-time filters and metrics. The final classification was superimposed with the irrigated agriculture data from Pousa et al. and CODEVASF.",
  "modal_info_paraghaph05": "The validation of the classification was done by cross-comparing the data on landuse datasets from the MapBiomas consortium, PRODES Cerrado project, TerraClass and the data from the IBGE agricultural census.",
